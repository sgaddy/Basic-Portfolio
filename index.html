			<h2>About Me</h2>			
			<img CLASS="TextWrapLeft" src="assets/image/200.jpg" width="140" height="100">
			<p>My name is Piggly. I am a domesticated pig. I eat both plants and meat. Sometimes, I even eat metal.  Just kidding.  I am highly sociable and intelligent.  I can be trained to perform numerous tasks and tricks. There are about 1 billion of us alive at any time.  We are one of the most numerous large mammals on the planet. Our ancestor the wild boar are also one of the most numerous and widespread large mammals in nature.  As an adult pig, I can weight between 50 and 350 kg (110 and 770 lb).  I enjoy seeking the company of other pigs and often I huddle with other pigs to maintain physical contact. Here are pictures of me when I was a baby.__________ and with my best friend.__________</p>
